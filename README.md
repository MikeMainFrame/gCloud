# gCloud - a lab copy of google example
I try to migrate a LAMP solution, where the backend, is replaced by Google Cloud Storage and Google App Engine.
For years I used the stack, with great success. But my hosting service provider, is a shadow of former might.
Declining for more than 10 years and damn expensive. No HTTPSsupport and my mail is hosted on Microsoft Exchange, which I find
likewise declining (MS) and damn annoying.
So this solution use classic AJAX - and yes - I master promise, but love procudural approach, therefore I use classic call-back.

Hope you find my cash register fascinating. I use SVG, javascript, PHP, XSLt, XML as base. The xml part will be changed to json in version 2.0.
